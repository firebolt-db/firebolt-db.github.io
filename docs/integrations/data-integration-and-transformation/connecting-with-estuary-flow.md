# Connecting with Estuary Flow

Estuary Flow is an ELT and data operations platform tool for building and testing data pipelines to continuously capture, transform, and materialize data. 

The Flow connector for Firebolt materializes delta updates of Flow collections into fact or dimension tables. For more information, see [Firebolt materialization connector](https://docs.estuary.dev/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Firebolt/) in Flow documentation.
