# Connecting apps and services using the JDBC driver

Firebolt provides a JDBC driver (Type 4) that can be used with most applications and tools that support JDBC for connecting to a database server. The driver is provided as a JAR file and requires Java 1.8 (or higher).

## Downloading the driver

Use one of the following links to download Firebolt's JDBC driver:
