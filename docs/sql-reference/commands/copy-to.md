# COPY TO (Beta)
{: .no_toc}

Copies (exports or unloads) the results of a `SELECT` query to an Amazon S3 location in the file format that you specify.

* Topic ToC
{:toc}

## Syntax

```sql
COPY (<select_query>)
  TO '<s3_location>'
  CREDENTIALS = <aws_credentials>
[ TYPE = CSV | TSV | JSON | PARQUET ]
[ COMPRESSION = GZIP | NONE ]
[ INCLUDE_QUERY_ID_IN_FILE_NAME = TRUE | FALSE ]
[ FILE_NAME_PREFIX = <file_string> ]
[ SINGLE_FILE = FALSE | TRUE ]
[ MAX_FILE_SIZE = <bytes> ]
[ OVERWRITE_EXISTING_FILES = FALSE | TRUE ]
```

| Parameter | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| `<select_query>`  | Any valid `SELECT` statement.|
| `<s3_location>` | The path to an S3 location where the query result file or files are saved. For example, `s3://my_bucket/my_folder`.|
| `CREDENTIALS` | The Amazon S3 credentials for accessing the specified `<s3_location>`. See [CREDENTIALS](#credentials) below.|
| `TYPE`            | Specifies the file type to save to S3. If omitted, `CSV` is the default. |
| `COMPRESSION`     | Specifies whether file compression is used. If omitted, defaults to `GZIP` compression format. If `NONE` is specified, exported files are not compressed.|
| `INCLUDE_QUERY_ID_IN_FILE_NAME` | Specifies whether a query ID is included in the file name. Each time the statement runs, Firebolt generates a new query ID. If omitted, defaults to `TRUE`, and Firebolt saves file names using the pattern `<query_id>.[type].gz`, for example, `123ABCXY2.csv.gz`. This allows Firebolt to generate unique file names by default. If `FALSE`, and `FILE_NAME_PREFIX` is not specified, files are exported with a generic `output` file name, for example, `output.csv.gz`.|
| `FILE_NAME_PREFIX`              | Specifies an optional string to use in the file name. If `FILE_NAME_PREFIX` is omitted and `INCLUDE_QUERY_ID_IN_FILE_NAME` is `TRUE`, the exported file name is in the pattern `<query_id><file_string>.<type>.gz`. If `FILE_NAME_PREFIX` is specified and `INCLUDE_QUERY_ID_IN_FILE_NAME` is set to `FALSE`, the specified string replaces `output` and the file is in the pattern `<file_string>.<type>.gz`. |
| `SINGLE_FILE`                   | Specifies whether the export should be a single file or multiple files. If omitted, the default is `FALSE`, and the export is split based on the `MAX_FILE_SIZE` value. Exported files are appended with `_<n>` incrementally to indicate the position in series, starting with `0`. For example, the first file in a series might be named `123ABCXY2_0.parquet.gz`. If `TRUE`, only a single file is written. If set to `TRUE` and the file exceeds `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, an error occurs. |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE`                 | Specifies the max file size in bytes. If omitted, the default value is `16000000` (16 MB). The maximum file size that can be specified is `5000000000` (5 GB). |
| `OVERWRITE_EXISTING_FILES`      | Specifies whether exported files should overwrite existing files of the same name in the specified S3 location. If omitted, defaults to `FALSE`, and files of the same name are not overwritten. |

## CREDENTIALS

Firebolt needs permissions to write query results to the specified S3 location. You can specify IAM credentials using either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role or AWS access keys, and the specified credentials must be associated with a user or role with permissions to write objects to the bucket.

### Specifying an IAM Role

Specify an AWS IAM Role ARN using the syntax shown below.

```sql
CREDENTIALS = (AWS_ROLE_ARN=<role_arn>) [AWS_ROLE_EXTERNAL_ID='<external_id>']
```

* `<role_arn>` is the ARN of a role that you have configured for Firebolt access to the specified `<s3_location>`, for example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-firebolt-access-role`.
* `<external_id>` is an optional arbitrary string that you assign to an IAM role when you create it, for example, `99291`.

For more information about creating roles for Firebolt, see [Using AWS roles to access Amazon S3](../../loading-data/configuring-aws-role-to-access-amazon-s3.md).

### Specifying AWS access keys

Specify access key credentials using the syntax shown below.

```sql
CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID = '<aws_key_id>' AWS_SECRET_KEY = '<aws_secret_key>')
```

* `<aws_key_id>` is the AWS access key id associated with a user or role, for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`.
* `<aws_secret_key>` is the AWS secret key, for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`.

For more information about access keys, see [Programmatic access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) in the *AWS General Reference*.

### Least privileged permissions

The example AWS IAM policy statement below demonstrates the minimum actions that must be allowed for Firebolt to write query files to an example S3 location. A permissions policy that allows at least these actions for the `<s3_location>` that you specify in the `COPY TO` statement must be attached to the user or role specified in the `CREDENTIALS` clause.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::my_s3_bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::my_s3_bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Examples

* [COPY TO with defaults and role ARN](#copy-to-with-defaults-and-role-arn)
* [COPY TO with single file and AWS access keys](#copy-to-with-single-file-and-aws-access-keys)
* [COPY TO with custom file name prefix and ARN with external ID](#copy-to-with-custom-file-name-prefix-and-arn-with-external-id)
* [COPY TO with custom file name and overwrite set to TRUE](#copy-to-with-custom-file-name-and-overwrite-set-to-true)

### COPY TO with defaults and role ARN

The example below shows a `COPY TO` statement with minimal parameters that specifies an `AWS_ROLE_ARN`. Because `TYPE` is omitted, the file or files will be written in CSV format, and because `COMPRESSION` is omitted, they are compressed using GZIP  (`*.csv.gz`).

```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM test_table)
  TO 's3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries'
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_ROLE_ARN='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-firebolt-role');
```

Firebolt assigns the query ID `16B903C4206098FD` to the query at runtime. The compressed output is 40 MB, exceeding the default of 16 MB, so Firebolt writes 4 files as shown below.

```bash
s3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries/
  16B903C4206098FD_0.csv.gz
  16B903C4206098FD_1.csv.gz
  16B903C4206098FD_2.csv.gz
  16B903C4206098FD_3.csv.gz
```

### COPY TO with single file and AWS access keys

The example below exports a single, uncompressed JSON file with the same name as the query ID. If the file to be written exceeds the specified `MAX_FILE_SIZE` (5 GB), an error occurs. AWS access keys are specified for credentials.

```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM test_table)
  TO 's3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries'
  TYPE=JSON
  COMPRESSION=NONE
  CREDENTIALS=(AWS_KEY_ID='AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE' AWS_SECRET_KEY='wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY')
  INCLUDE_QUERY_ID_IN_FILE_NAME=TRUE
  SINGLE_FILE=TRUE
  MAX_FILE_SIZE=5000000000;
```

Firebolt writes a single file as shown below.

```bash
s3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries/
  16B90E96716236D0.json
```

### COPY TO with custom file name prefix and ARN with external ID

In the example below, because `FILE_NAME_PREFIX` parameter is specified, Firebolt adds a string to the query ID to form file names. The IAM role specified for `CREDENTIALS` also has an external ID configured in AWS, so the ID is specified.

```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM test_table)
  TO 's3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries'
  TYPE=JSON
  COMPRESSION=NONE
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_ROLE_ARN='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-firebolt-role' AWS_ROLE_EXTERNAL_ID='99291')
  FILE_NAME_PREFIX='_query_result';
```

Firebolt assigns the query an id of `16B90E96716236D6` at runtime and writes files as shown below.

```bash
s3://my_bucket/my_fb_queries/
  16B90E96716236D6_query_result_0.json
  16B90E96716236D6_query_result_1.json
  16B90E96716236D6_query_result_2.json
  16B90E96716236D6_query_result_3.json
  16B90E96716236D6_query_result_4.json
```  

### COPY TO with custom file name and overwrite set to TRUE

In the example below, `INCLUDE_QUERY_ID_IN_FILE_NAME` is set to `FALSE` and a `FILE_NAME_PREFIX` is specified. In this case, Firebolt writes files using only the specified `FILE_NAME_PREFIX` as the file name. In addition, `SINGLE_FILE` and `OVERWRITE_EXISTING_FILES` are set to `TRUE` so that the S3 location always contains a single file with the latest query results.

```sql
COPY (SELECT * FROM test_table)
  TO 's3://my_bucket/my_fb_query'
  TYPE=JSON
  COMPRESSION=NONE
  CREDENTIALS=(AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-firebolt-role')
  INCLUDE_QUERY_ID_IN_FILE_NAME=FALSE
  SINGLE_FILE=TRUE
  FILE_NAME_PREFIX='latest-fb-query-result'
  MAX_FILE_SIZE=5000000000
  OVERWRITE_EXISTING_FILES=TRUE;
```

Firebolt writes a single file as shown below.

```bash
s3://my_bucket/my_fb-query/
  latest-fb-query-result.json
```
