# EXTRACT (legacy)

{: .warning}
  >You are looking at legacy documentation for Firebolt's deprecated date and timestamp type functions.
  >New types were introduced in DB version 3.19 under the names `PGDATE` and `TIMESTAMPNTZ`, and made generally available in DB version 3.22.
  >
  >If you worked with Firebolt before DB version 3.22, you might still be using the legacy date and timestamp types.
  >Determine which types you are using by executing the query `SELECT EXTRACT(CENTURY FROM DATE '2023-03-16');`.
  >If this query returns an error, you are still using the legacy date and timestamp types and can continue with this documentation, or find instructions to use the new types [here](../../release-notes/release-notes.md#date-and-timestamp-names-available-for-new-data-types).
  >If this query returns a result, you are already using the redesigned date and timestamp types and can use the [EXTRACT](./extract-new.md) function instead.

Retrieves the time unit, such as `year` or `hour`, from a `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, or `TIMESTAMPTZ` value.

## Syntax
{: .no_toc}

```sql
EXTRACT(<time_unit> FROM <expression>)
```

## Parameters
{: .no_toc}

| Parameter      | Description                                           | Supported input types                                                                                                                               |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<time_unit>`  | The time unit to extract from the expression.         | `microseconds`, `milliseconds`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`, `decade`, `century`, `millennium` (unquoted) |
| `<expression>` | The expression from which the time unit is extracted. | `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`                                                                                                                  |

`TIMESTAMPTZ` values are converted from Unix time to local time according to the session's `time_zone` setting before extracting the `time_unit`.
The set of allowed `time_unit` values depends on the data type of `<expression>`.
Furthermore, the return type depends on the `time_unit`.

## Remarks
{: .no_toc}

The `EXTRACT` function can be used in the `PARTITION BY` clause of `CREATE TABLE` commands.

```sql
CREATE DIMENSION TABLE test (
  d DATE,
  t TIMESTAMP
)
PARTITION BY EXTRACT(month FROM d), EXTRACT(hour FROM t);
```
