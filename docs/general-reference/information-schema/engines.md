# Information schema for engines

You can use the `information_schema.engines` view to return information about each engine in an account. The view is available for each database and contains one row for each engine in the account. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each engine as shown in the example below, which uses a `WHERE` clause to return all engines attached to databases that begin with `deng`.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.engines
WHERE
  attached_to ILIKE 'deng%'
```

## Columns in information_schema.engines

Each row has the following columns with information about each engine.

| Name                        | Data Type   | Description |
