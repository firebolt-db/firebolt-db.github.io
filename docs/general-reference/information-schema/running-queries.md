# Information schema for running queries

You can use the `information_schema.running_queries` view to return information about queries currently running in a database. The view is available in each database and contains one row for each running query in the database. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each running query as shown in the example below.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
   information_schema.running_queries
LIMIT
  100;
```
