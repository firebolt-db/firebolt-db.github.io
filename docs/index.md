# Firebolt documentation
{:.no_toc}

Firebolt is a cloud data warehouse purpose-built to provide sub-second analytics performance on massive, terabyte-scale data sets. Our documentation can help you load and model your data in Firebolt, optimize for performance, and build your analytics and data applications quickly.

* To start with a hands-on test drive, jump in with the [Getting started](getting-started.md) tutorial. You'll need a Firebolt account first. To get one, [Schedule a call](https:///www.firebolt.io/getting-started-now?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=docs&utm-campaign=docs-demo) to answer your questions and get set up.
* To understand what's under the hood, check out [Key concepts and architecture](architecture-overview.md), and then see the [Firebolt cloud data warehouse whitepaper](https://www.firebolt.io/resources/firebolt-cloud-data-warehouse-whitepaper) for more detail.
