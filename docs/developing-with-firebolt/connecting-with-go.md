# Go

Firebolt provides a Go SDK for developing Go applications on Firebolt. The Firebolt Go SDK implements the [`database/sql/driver`](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) specification in Go's standard library. For installation and usage instructions, see the [firebolt-go-sdk](https://github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-go-sdk) repository on GitHub.
