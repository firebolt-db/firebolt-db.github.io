* [Resolved issues](#resolved-issues)
  
### Enhancements, changes, and new integrations

* <!--- FIR-20900 —--> **Function support added for new `PGDATE`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, and `TIMESTAMPNTZ` data types**

  The following new and updated functions can now be used with new data types `PGDATE`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, and `TIMESTAMPNTZ`.

  * [TO_CHAR](../sql-reference/functions-reference/to-char-new.md)
  * [CURRENT_PGDATE](../sql-reference/functions-reference/current-pgdate.md)
  * [LOCALTIMESTAMPNTZ](../sql-reference/functions-reference/localtimestampntz.md)
  * [CURRENT_TIMESTAMPTZ](../sql-reference/functions-reference/current-timestamptz.md)
  * [TO_TIMESTAMPTZ](../sql-reference/functions-reference/to-timestamptz.md)

{: .warning}
  >**To use the new data types, new external and dimension/fact tables must be created. Reingest will be required to recognize new precision.**
  >* To ingest from an existing table into a new table using the new types, simply cast a column of type `DATE` to `PGDATE` and a column of type >`TIMESTAMP` to `TIMESTAMPNTZ`. 
  >* To ingest into a new table using the new types from external data, create an external table with the new types.
  >
  >In a future version, you will have the option to use the type names `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` instead of new type names `PGDATE` and `TIMESTAMPNTZ`, but data must be reingested using the new types before this option is enabled. `TIMESTAMPTZ` will remain the same, as that is a new type added. Please raise any questions or feedback with your Customer Success team. 

* <!--- FIR-18850 —--> **Changed NULL behavior of `CONCAT` function**

  NULL inputs to [the `CONCAT` function](../sql-reference/functions-reference/concat.md) are now treated as empty strings, therefore any NULL inputs are ignored. When all inputs are NULL, the result will be an empty string. When using `||`, any NULL input still results in a NULL output.

{: .warning}
  >If you are using the `CONCAT` function on strings with NULL inputs and you don't want NULL values to be ignored, you will need to use the `||` function instead.
  
* <!--- FIR-21015 —--> **Additional syntax for ARRAY data type names**

  Syntax options for defining columns with [the `ARRAY` data type](../general-reference/data-types.md#array) have been updated to include `<data-type>[]` and `<data-type> ARRAY`. Array element type is nullable when using the new syntax options. 

  For example, the following three queries will create tables with the same `demo_array` column of type `ARRAY` of nullable `TEXT`.

  ```sql
  CREATE DIMENSION TABLE demo1 (
  demo_array ARRAY(TEXT NULL)
  );
  
  CREATE DIMENSION TABLE demo2 (
  demo_array TEXT[]
  );

  CREATE DIMENSION TABLE demo3 (
  demo_array TEXT ARRAY
  );
  ```
 To specify the constraint for an array element to be not nullable, you must then use `ARRAY(<data-type> NOT NULL)` syntax.

* <!--- FIR-20822 —--> **Added flag support for `REGEXP_LIKE`**

  The [`REGEXP_LIKE` function](../sql-reference/functions-reference/regexp-like.md) now supports an optional `<flag>` input, to allow additional controls over the regular's expression matching behavior.

  For example, the `i` flag causes the regular expression matching in the following query to be case-insensitive. Without this flag, the query would not find a match and would return `0`.

  ```sql
  SELECT
	  REGEXP_LIKE('ABC', '[a-z]', 'i'); ---> 1
  ```

* <!--- FIR-20808 —--> **Parquet and ORC support added for binary data type**

  Binary type data from external Parquet or ORC file types will now be ingested directly with [the data type `BYTEA`](../general-reference/bytea-data-type.md#importing-bytea-from-external-source). Previously, data were ingested as type `TEXT` and then converted to data type `BYTEA`. 

* <!--- FIR-21179 —--> **Export all results from the SQL Workspace**  (UI release)

  [Exporting the entire results section](../using-the-sql-workspace/using-the-sql-workspace.md#exporting-results-to-a-local-hard-drive) from the SQL Workspace in CSV or JSON format is now supported.

* <!--- FIR-19287 —--> **Renamed column from `information_schema.tables`**

  Renamed the `number_of_segments` column from `information_schema.tables` to `number_of_tablets` to better reflect Firebolt's data structure.

* <!--- FIR-21118 —--> **Added support for empty statements**

  Empty statements containing comments only are now supported and will run without error. 

  ```sql
  SELECT
	  REGEXP_LIKE('ABC', '[a-z]', 'i'); ---> 1
  ```

* <!--- FIR-20808 —--> **Parquet and ORC support added for binary data type**

  Binary type data from external Parquet or ORC file types will now be ingested directly with the data type `BYTEA`. Previously, data were ingested as type `TEXT` and then converted to data type `BYTEA`. 

* <!--- FIR-21118 —--> **Added support for empty statements**

  Empty statements containing comments only are now supported and will run without error. 

* <!--- FIR-21179 —--> **Export all results from the SQL Workspace**

  [Exporting the entire results section](../using-the-sql-workspace/using-the-sql-workspace.md#exporting-results-to-a-local-hard-drive) from the SQL Workspace in CSV or JSON format is now supported.

* <!--- FIR-19287 —--> **Renamed column from `information_schema.tables`**

  Renamed the `number_of_segments` column from `information_schema.tables` to `number_of_tablets` to better reflect Firebolt's data structure.

* <!--- FIR-21118 —--> **Added support for empty statements**

  Empty statements containing comments only are now supported and will run without error. 

### Resolved issues

* <!--- FIR-20808 —-->Fixed an issue where `AVG` and `SUM` functions performed on large `DECIMAL` columns produced an error; results now use the same precision and scale as the input type. 

## DB version 3.19.0 
**February 2023**

* [New features](#new-features)
* [Enhancements, changes, and new integrations](#enhancements-changes-and-new-integrations)

### New features

* <!--- FIR-16297 —--> **New date and time data types**

  Added support for new date and timestamp data types:

  * [PGDATE](../general-reference/date-data-type.md)
  * [TIMESTAMPNTZ](../general-reference/timestampntz-data-type.md)
  * [TIMESTAMPTZ](../general-reference/timestamptz-data-type.md)

  The new data types use an improved memory layout providing a much higher supported range, now extending from `0001-01-01[ 00:00:00.000000]` to `9999-12-31[ 23:59:59.999999]`. This change also extends the syntax for specifying intervals used for arithmetic with dates and timestamps. In addition to the previously supported interval syntax, you can now also write `interval 'N' unit`, where `N` is a possibly signed integer, and `unit` is one of `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, or `second`, matched case-insensitively.

  The previously supported `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` data types are planned for deprecation in the future. New features and functionality will be built to support the new date and timestamp data types, rather than these legacy types. 
  
  **To use the new data types, new external and dimension/fact tables must be created. Reingest will be required to recognize new precision.**
  * To ingest from an existing table into a new table using the new types, simply cast a column of type `DATE` to `PGDATE` and a column of type `TIMESTAMP` to `TIMESTAMPNTZ`. 
  * To ingest into a new table using the new types from external data, create an external table with the new types.

  {: .warning}
  The new syntax can break the semantics of existing SQL queries. Previously, the `unit` part of the expression was treated as a column alias, and now it's treated as part of the interval literal. For example, if you wrote `SELECT DATE '2023-01-10' + interval '42' day;`, you would get back a table with one column called `day` and the value `2023-01-10 00:00:42`. Now, you will get a back a table with one column (unspecified name) and the value `2023-02-21 00:00:00`.<br>If you want to retain the old behavior, use `AS`, for example: `SELECT DATE '2023-01-10' + interval '42' AS day;`.

* <!--- ---> **New setting for time zone**

  [New setting](../general-reference/system-settings.md#set-time-zone) `time_zone` controls the session time zone. The default value of the `time_zone` setting is UTC.

* <!--- FIR-13488, FIR-20666 ---> **New keyboard shortcuts** (UI release)

  Use new [keyboard shortcuts](../using-the-sql-workspace/keyboard-shortcuts-for-sql-workspace.md) in the SQL workspace to cancel a query, or go to a specific line in your script.  

    * Cancel a running script with **Ctrl + Alt + k** for Windows & Linux, or **⌘ + Option + k** for Mac
    * Go to a desired line with **Ctrl + l** for Windows & Linux, or **⌘ + l** for Mac
  
### Enhancements, changes, and new integrations

* <!--- FIR-16389 —--> **Improved join index performance**

  [Join indexes](../using-indexes/using-join-indexes.md) just got better: profit from their extreme performance benefits without any configuration. Moreover, there is no more need to manually create or refresh – the results are always up to date even if the underlying data changed.  With this optimization, we've seen real-world, production queries run 200x faster.

  To see how this works, let’s look at an example. Say we have the following query pattern which is run hundreds of times per second with different values for `l.player_id` and `l.date`:

  ```sql
  SELECT r.name, SUM(l.score) 
  FROM   game_plays as l
  JOIN   player_info as r 
  ON     l.player_id = r.player_id
  WHERE  l.player_id = XXX AND l.date = YYY
  GROUP  BY r.name;
  ```

  On the first run of this query, the relevant data from the right-hand side table `player_info` is read and stored in a specialized data structure, which is cached in RAM. This can take tens of seconds if the `player_info` table is large (e.g., contains millions of rows). However, on subsequent runs of the query pattern, the cached data structure can be reused - so all subsequent queries will only take a few milliseconds (if the left-hand side with potential field restrictions is small, as here).

  **Requirements for query optimization**
    * The right side of the join in the query must be directly a table. Subselects are not supported.
    * Restrictions on fields from the right side of the join need to be applied in an `OUTER SELECT`, wrapping the query.
    * Since the join index data structure is cached in RAM, the right side table may not be too large (by default the size of the cache is limited to 20% of the RAM).
    * All types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, …) are supported.
    * The right table in the join can be a FACT or DIMENSION table.  

* <!--- FIR-11922 —-->**Improved cache eviction**

  Cache eviction process and stability has been improved. Tablet eviction is now managed by a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm, which provides smarter eviction and keeps the data that is most likely to be accessed in the engine cache.

* <!--- FIR-17198 —-->**Added syntax option for setting TYPE options in CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE**
  
  Added the option to set type options for S3 source files at the same level as `TYPE` is set. [Type option](../sql-reference/commands/create-external-table.md#type) can now be defined as in the example below:

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ex_table( ... )
  TYPE=(CSV)
  ALLOW_COLUMN_MISMATCH=true
  ...
  ```

  as well as with the original syntax: 

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ex_table(...)
  TYPE=(CSV ALLOW_COLUMN_MISMATCH=true)
  ...
  ```

* <!--- FIR-20566 —-->**Default DECIMAL scale changed**

  The default scale for the `DECIMAL` [data type](../general-reference/decimal-data-type.md) has been updated from 0 to 9.

* <!--- FIR-16745 --->**New setting for parsing literal strings**

  [New setting](../general-reference/system-settings.md#enable-parsing-for-literal-strings) `standard_conforming_strings` controls whether strings are parsed without escaping, treating backslashes literally.

* <!--- FIR-13489 --->**New keyboard shortcuts** (UI release)

  Use new [keyboard shortcuts](../using-the-sql-workspace/keyboard-shortcuts-for-sql-workspace.md) in the SQL workspace to save and close scripts, and expand or collapse the results pane. 

    * Close the current script in the SQL workspace with **Ctrl + Alt + x** for Windows & Linux, or **⌘ + Option + x** for Mac
    * Close all scripts in the SQL workspace with **Ctrl + Alt + g** for Windows & Linux, or **⌘ + Option + g** for Mac

### New features

* <!--- FIR-15968, FIR-15744 —-->**Added support for functions** (DB version 3.13.0)

  * [FIRST_VALUE](../sql-reference/functions-reference/first-value.md): Returns the first value evaluated in the specified window frame.
  * [NTH_VALUE](../sql-reference/functions-reference/nth-value.md): Returns the value evaluated of the nth row of the specified window frame (starting at the first row).
  * [NTILE](../sql-reference/functions-reference/ntile.md): Divides an ordered data set equally into a specified number of buckets.
  * [CUME\_DIST](../sql-reference/functions-reference/cume-dist.md): Calculates the relative rank (cumulative distribution) of the current row in relation to other rows in the same partition within an ordered data set.
  * [PERCENT\_RANK](../sql-reference/functions-reference/percent-rank.md): Calculates the relative rank of the current row within an ordered data set.
  * [PERCENTILE\_CONT (aggregation function)](../sql-reference/functions-reference/percentile-cont.md): Calculates a percentile, assuming a continuous distribution of values.
  * [PERCENTILE\_CONT (window function)](../sql-reference/functions-reference/percentile-cont-window.md): Calculates a percentile over a partition, assuming a continuous distribution of values.
  * [PERCENTILE\_DISC (aggregation function)](../sql-reference/functions-reference/percentile-disc.md): Returns a percentile for an ordered data set, equal to a specific column value.
  * [PERCENTILE\_DISC (window function)](../sql-reference/functions-reference/percentile-disc-window.md): Returns a percentile over a partition for an ordered data set, equal to a specific column value.


* <!--- FIR-15007 —-->**Added support for TRUNCATE TABLE command** (DB version 3.11.0)
  
  Use the [TRUNCATE TABLE](../sql-reference/commands/truncate-table.md) command to remove all rows from a table. 

* <!--- FIR-12587 —-->**Added support for DECIMAL data type** (DB version 3.13.0)

  Beta support for the [DECIMAL](decimal-data-type.md) data type is coming in version 3.13. 

  {: .warning}
  In previous versions, DECIMAL type columns are stored as DOUBLE type. Therefore, this change may require your action. Restart analytics engines before general purpose engines to use this new feature, and see below for additional actions. 
  
  **If your existing data model contains tables defined with DOUBLE type columns:**
  * If you want to preserve the DOUBLE data type going forward, no change is required. The DECIMAL data type can be used for new tables/columns.
   
  **If your existing data model contains tables defined with DECIMAL type columns:**
   * If you do not want to change your tables, no action is required. These columns will just show up as type DOUBLE. You can safely use the DECIMAL type for new tables/columns.

   * If your table defined with columns as DECIMAL are recreated periodically (by your ELT process), new columns will be defined as DECIMAL(38,0) – default precision and scale. If you don’t want to switch to the DECIMAL data type for the existing data flows, you can change your ELT flows and replace the DECIMAL keyword with DOUBLE.

   * If you are using a function with a DECIMAL type in your ELT process, ensure that function is [supported for the DECIMAL data type](decimal-data-type.md#supported-functions-beta-release).  

   * To change the data type of columns defined as DECIMAL but stored as DOUBLE, you will need to recreate the table with the new definition (column defined as DECIMAL(p,s)). To avoid precision loss, we highly recommend re-ingesting the data from the source (i.e., via external table) rather than casting values to decimal from the existing table (i.e., `INSERT INTO new_table(d) SELECT CAST(d as DECIMAL(38,9)) FROM old_table;`).
   
   * To avoid any downtime for the end-users in scenarios involving re-creating and re-ingesting the table, we suggest creating a view that reads from the existing table (`old_table`). After the new table (`new_table`) is created and data is ingested, repoint the view to the new table name (`new_table`) using the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` command. 
 
  **Examples of changes in behavior**
 
  * Comparing two values that differ by a small offset yields different results when stored as DECIMAL vs. DOUBLE, because DOUBLE is a variable-precision data type, whereas DECIMAL is exact with fixed precision:
  ```sql
      SELECT '1.00000000000000000000000005'::DECIMAL(38,30) = '1.00000000000000000000000004999'::DECIMAL(38,30); -- false
      SELECT '1.00000000000000000000000005'::DOUBLE = '1.00000000000000000000000004999'::DOUBLE;  --true
  ```

  * Expressions involving DECIMAL data types with different precision and scale will yield an error:
  ```sql
    SELECT 3::DECIMAL + 2::DECIMAL(3,1); -- Invalid operation error: Operations between decimals with different precision and scale is not supported at the moment. Explicitly cast one of the decimals to other decimal precision and scale.
  ```

  * Functions `ROUND`, `TO_STRING`, and `TO_TEXT` applied on DECIMAL will return the data type matching the input data type. 

### Enhancements, changes, and new integrations

* <!--- FIR-16295 —-->**Information schema updated** (DB version 3.13.0)

  Added `cpu_usage_us` and `cpu_delay_us` columns to the [information_schema.query_history view](../general-reference/information-schema/query-history-view.md) view.

  For more information, see [Information schema for query history](../general-reference/information-schema/query-history-view.md) and [Information schema for running queries](../general-reference/information-schema/running-queries.md).

* **Added support for Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
  **(Beta)**

  Firebolt now supports Multi-factor authentication. 
 
  You can enable MFA for users or groups with the Firebolt Manager which sends a link to enroll in MFA using a QR code. When a user enrolls in MFA from the email, the status in Firebolt updates to **MFA enabled**.

  **To enable MFA for a Firebolt user or group of users** choose the **User Management** icon in the navigation pane. If the icon isn't available, you don't have Account Admin permissions. 
    
  ![User management icon](../assets/images/user-management.png)
  
  For more information, see [Configuring MFA for users (Beta)](../managing-your-account/managing-users.md#configuring-mfa-for-users-beta).

* **Added support for the hll\_count\_distinct(input, [, precision]) function**
  **(DB version 3.7.0)**

  Allows for precision control of the count(distinct <expr>) function with an optional precision parameter.
  
  Requires less memory than exact aggregation functions, like `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, but also introduces statistical uncertainty. The default precision is 12, with a maximum of 20.

* **Added new data type aliases**
  **(DB version 3.7.0)**

  Data type aliases have been added for `REAL`, `FLOAT4`, `FLOAT8`, `INT4`, `INT8`, and `FLOAT(p)`. For more information on data types and their aliases (synonyms), see [Data types](data-types.md).

* **Updated INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS**
  **(DB version 3.8.0)** 

  Now includes more metadata on columns, as well as columns for views in a given database.

* **New script processing status in browser tab**

  Added a status indicator in the browser tab so when multiple tabs are open in the browser, you can switch to a different tab and still track the status of your running script. The status adds a color coded indicator dot to the Firebolt icon in the tab. A green dot indicates the script completed successfully. The status remains in the tab for one minute after the script completes running. 
  
  For more information about this new status indicator, and running scripts, see [Running scripts and working with results](../using-the-sql-workspace/using-the-sql-workspace.md#running-scripts-and-working-with-results).

## July 2022

* [Enhancements, changes, and new integrations](#enhancements-changes-and-new-integrations)
* [Resolved issues](#resolved-issues)

### Enhancements, changes, and new integrations

* **Added support for Airbyte**
 
  The Firebolt integration includes an [Airbyte Source](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/firebolt/){:target="_blank"} connector as well as an [Airbyte Destination](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/firebolt){:target="_blank"} connector, which allow you to easily move data into and out of Firebolt. 
  
  For more information on Airbyte, see [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/){:target="_blank"}.

* **New billing breakdown in engine dashboard**
  
  The billing breakdown in the engine dashboard can now show billing or running time.

  ![Billing time](../assets/images/release-notes/billing-time.png)
 
* **Added an optional `<format>` parameter to the `TO_DATE` and `TO_TIMESTAMP` functions**
  
  The `<format>` parameter allows you to use a string literal, as shown in [DATE_FORMAT](../sql-reference/functions-reference/date-format.md), to specify the format of the string to convert. This hint helps the date-time parser to improve performance. For more information, see [TO_DATE](../sql-reference/functions-reference/to-date.md) and [TO_TIMESTAMP](../sql-reference/functions-reference/to-timestamp.md).

### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue that prevented values from being set properly for a column with a `DEFAULT` constraint when an `INSERT INTO` statement ran without specifying the column value. 

  For example, consider the following fact table and `INSERT INTO` statement.   

  ```sql
  CREATE FACT TABLE t8
  (
       col1 INT  NULL ,
       col2 INT  NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       col3 INT  NULL DEFAULT 1,
       col4 INT  NOT NULL DEFAULT 3,
       col5 TEXT
  )
  PRIMARY INDEX col2;

  INSERT INTO t8 (col1,col2,col3,col5) VALUES (1,1,1,'a'); 
  ```
  
  Before the fix, `SELECT * FROM t8` would return `(1,1,1,0,'a')`. The statement now returns the expected values, `(1,1,1,3,'a')`.

* Fixed a case where the `APPROX_PERCENTILE` function returns an error when running over an expression derived from multiple tables. 

* `JSON_EXTRACT` now supports the `STRING` data type as the expected type in addition to the `TEXT` data type.

* Fixed an issue where a username that contained special alphabetical characters was not recognized when registering a Firebolt user. 

* Concatenating multiple arrays using the `||` operator now produces an array containing the input array values.

* Fixed an issue where an array of `LONG`s could be displayed as an array of `TEXT`s in the SQL Workspace.

* Fixed an issue that prevented a database without engines from being edited.
